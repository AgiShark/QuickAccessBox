To keep the size down use IrfanView or similar and batch convert all newly generated thumbnails with these settings:
- Use 64x64 resolution, anything higher will not have a positive quality difference.
- Do not use transparency, instead use 245,245,245 as background color.
- Use 256 colors (8 Bits Per Pixel with no alpha channel).
